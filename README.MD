# 6502 Operations in JSON

This is a collection of 6502 operations in JSON format. Why? I couldn't find a good source of 6502 operations in JSON format. I wanted to use this in a project I'm working on. I figured someone else might find it useful.

If somthing is worng, please open an issue or submit a pull request. This was painful to write and partly generated by copilot both ai and human. 

## Usage

```shell
python3 gen.py 
```
